## Why Document Agents?

As agents become more complex and numerous, we need a standard way to describe what they can do. The `agents.md` file serves as a "user manual" that both humans and other AI systems can understand.

> **Key Insight**: A well-documented agent is a trustworthy agent. Clear boundaries and capabilities build confidence.

---

## 12.1 The agents.md Standard

The `agents.md` file is an open standard for documenting AI agent capabilities. It was recently donated to the Agentic AI Foundation alongside MCP.

### Core Sections

```markdown
# Agent Name

## Overview

Brief description of what this agent does.

## Capabilities

- What the agent CAN do
- Tools it has access to
- Data sources it can query

## Limitations

- What the agent CANNOT do
- Boundaries and restrictions
- Known failure modes

## Usage

How to interact with the agent effectively.

## Examples

Sample interactions and expected outputs.
```

## 12.3 Best Practices from 2,500+ Repositories

GitHub analyzed over 2,500 repositories with agents.md files. Here are the key findings:

### What Works

1. **Specific Tech Stack Versions**
   ```markdown
   ## Tech Stack
   - React 18.2.0
   - TypeScript 5.3
   - Node.js 20 LTS
````

Not just "React" but the specific version.

2. **Executable Commands**

   ```markdown
   ## Commands

   - `npm run dev` - Start development server
   - `npm test` - Run test suite
   - `npm run lint` - Check code style
   ```

3. **Clear Boundaries**

   ```markdown
   ## Do NOT

   - Modify package.json without approval
   - Delete test files
   - Change authentication logic
   ```

4. **Testing Procedures**
   ```markdown
   ## Testing

   1. Run `npm test` before committing
   2. Ensure coverage > 80%
   3. All E2E tests must pass
   ```

### What Doesn't Work

- Vague descriptions ("handles data")
- Missing version information
- No examples
- Outdated documentation

## 📚 Key Takeaways

1. **agents.md** is the standard for documenting agent capabilities
2. **Specificity** matters—versions, limits, boundaries
3. **Examples** are essential for understanding
4. **Machine-readable** metadata enables agent-to-agent discovery
5. **Limitations** are as important as capabilities
