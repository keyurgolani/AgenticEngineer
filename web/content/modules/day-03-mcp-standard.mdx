## 3.1 The "USB-C" of AI

Before 2025, every tool integration was custom.

- "I want to connect to Postgres" -> Import `langchain_postgres`.
- "I want to connect to Slack" -> Import `slack_sdk`.

This is unscalable. The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** standardizes this. You write a tool **once**, and it works for Claude, Cursor, and any custom Agent.

## 3.2 Key Concepts

- **Clients**: The Agent (e.g., Claude Desktop, your script).
- **Servers**: The Tool Provider (e.g., a process giving access to SQLite).
- **Resources**: Passive data (files, logs). GET requests.
- **Tools**: Active functions (execute_query). POST requests.

## 3.3 Implementation: Using the Python SDK

We will use MCP in Project 5, but here is the mental model:

```python
# The Old Way (Proprietary)
# import specific_library
# result = specific_library.do_thing()

# The Agentic Way (MCP)
# client.connect("sqlite-server")
# tools = client.list_tools()
# >> ["query_db", "list_tables"]
# client.call_tool("query_db", {"sql": "SELECT * FROM users"})
```

<Callout type="important">
  **Why this matters:** This decouples your agent logic from the tools. You can
  swap the "SQLite Server" with a "Postgres Server" and your agent code _does
  not change_, as long as the tools have the same schema.
</Callout>
