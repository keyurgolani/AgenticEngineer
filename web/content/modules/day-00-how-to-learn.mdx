## Understanding the Module Structure

Each module follows a consistent structure to help you learn effectively:

### At the Start of Each Module

| Element                 | Purpose                              |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Reading Time**        | Estimate how long the module takes   |
| **Skill Level**         | Visual indicator of difficulty       |
| **Prerequisites**       | What you should know before starting |
| **Learning Objectives** | What you'll be able to do after      |
| **Key Terms**           | New vocabulary introduced            |

### Throughout the Module

| Element                          | Purpose                                                                   |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ConceptIntro** (purple box)    | New concepts with simple analogies first, technical definitions on demand |
| **RealWorldExample** (green box) | Practical scenarios showing how concepts apply                            |
| **Callout boxes**                | Tips, warnings, and important notes                                       |
| **Mermaid diagrams**             | Visual representations of architectures and flows                         |
| **Code blocks**                  | Runnable examples you can copy                                            |

### At the End of Each Module

| Element                | Purpose                           |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| **ProgressCheckpoint** | Test your understanding with Q&A  |
| **CommonMistakes**     | Pitfalls to avoid                 |
| **Exercise**           | Hands-on practice with objectives |
| **ModuleSummary**      | Key takeaways to remember         |

## Learning Strategies

### For Conceptual Modules (Days 01-02)

1. **Read actively** — Don't just skim; engage with the analogies
2. **Draw diagrams** — Recreate the Mermaid charts by hand
3. **Explain to someone** — Teaching solidifies understanding
4. **Complete the checkpoint** — Don't skip the self-assessment

### For Coding Modules (Days 03-06)

1. **Type the code** — Don't copy-paste; typing builds muscle memory
2. **Run everything** — Verify each example works
3. **Break things** — Modify code to see what happens
4. **Build the exercises** — Hands-on practice is essential

### For Project Modules (Days 08, 10, 15, 17, 22)

1. **Plan first** — Sketch your architecture before coding
2. **Start simple** — Get a minimal version working, then enhance
3. **Debug systematically** — Use print statements and LangSmith
4. **Document your work** — Future you will thank present you

## Using the Interactive Features

### Glossary Terms

<Glossary
  term="Hover over terms like this"
  def="You'll see a definition popup explaining the concept."
/>

Terms with dotted underlines are interactive—hover to see definitions.

### Progress Checkpoints

These are self-assessment quizzes. Be honest with yourself:

- If you can't answer a question, re-read that section
- Aim for 100% before moving to the next module
- Use the "Reveal Answer" to check your understanding

### Exercises

Exercises have three difficulty levels:

- **Beginner**: Follow the instructions step-by-step
- **Intermediate**: Apply concepts with some guidance
- **Advanced**: Extend and combine concepts creatively

Use the hints if you're stuck, but try without them first.

## Getting Help

### When You're Stuck

1. **Re-read the section** — Often the answer is there
2. **Check the Glossary** — Make sure you understand the terms
3. **Review prerequisites** — You might have missed something earlier
4. **Search the error** — Stack Overflow and GitHub issues help
5. **Take a break** — Fresh eyes often see solutions

### Common Issues

<CommonMistakes
  mistakes={[
    {
      mistake: "Skipping the foundations because they seem 'basic'",
      fix: "Foundations contain crucial mental models. Skim if you must, but don't skip.",
    },
    {
      mistake: "Copy-pasting code without understanding it",
      fix: "Type it out. Modify it. Break it. That's how you learn.",
    },
    {
      mistake: "Moving on when a checkpoint question stumps you",
      fix: "That's a signal to re-read. Understanding compounds.",
    },
    {
      mistake: "Trying to build projects without doing the exercises",
      fix: "Exercises build the skills you need for projects. Do them.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Recommended Setup

- **Two monitors** (or split screen): Course on one, code on the other
- **Note-taking app**: Use the built-in notes feature or your own
- **Terminal ready**: Keep a Python environment active
- **LangSmith account**: For debugging agent traces
