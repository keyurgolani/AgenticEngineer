## The Road to 2027

You have now built:

1.  A **Reasoning Loop** (Deep Research).
2.  A **Reliability Loop** (K8s Operator).
3.  A **Privacy Sandbox** (Local Analyst).
4.  A **Deterministic Repair Agent** (Refactorer).
5.  A **Universal Interface** (MCP Swarm).

This is the toolkit of the **Agentic Engineer**. You are no longer limited by the context window or the fragility of a single prompt.

<Exercise title="Final Capstone Challenge">
**Goal:** Combine Project 1 and Project 5 to build a **"Market Analyst Swarm"**.

- **Supervisor**: Plans the analysis.
- **Worker 1 (MCP)**: Queries a Financial DB.
- **Worker 2 (Web)**: Searches News.
- **Worker 3 (Code)**: Plots the trend in E2B.

_Good luck, Architect._
