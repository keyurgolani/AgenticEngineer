### 27.1 Habits of the Top 1%

1.  **Read arXiv**: New papers drop daily. Read the Abstract.
2.  **Contribute to Open Source**: LangChain, AutoGen, and CrewAI move fast. Submit PRs.
3.  **Build in Public**: Share your "Failed Experiments". The community learns more from failures than polished demos.

### 27.2 Recommended Resources

- **Papers**: "Attention is All You Need", "ReAct", "Generative Agents".
- **Benchmarks**: SWE-bench, ARC-AGI.
