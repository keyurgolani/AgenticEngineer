### 5.1 The Parsing Problem

LLMs speak English. Computers speak JSON.
Regex parsing is fragile.
**Solution**: OpenAI Function Calling / Tool Use.

### 5.2 Pydantic

We use Pydantic to define the _Schema_ of what we want.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class UserProfile(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="The user's full name")
    age: int = Field(description="The user's age")
    interests: list[str]

# LangChain makes this easy
structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(UserProfile)
print(structured_llm.invoke("My name is John and I'm 25. I like coding."))
# Output: UserProfile(name='John', age=25, interests=['coding'])
```

### 5.3 Why is this "Agentic"?

Agents need to call tools. To call a tool `weather(city: str)`, the LLM _must_ output exactly `{"city": "Paris"}`.
Structured output is the bridge between the Brain and the Hands.
