### 29.1 Architecture Diagrams

A repository without a diagram is invisible.
Use **Mermaid.js** or Excalidraw to visualize your Multi-Agent loops.

### 29.2 Recording Demos

Record 1-minute Loom videos of your agents in action.
Embed them in your READMEs.
Recruiters do not clone repos; they watch videos.

### 29.3 Security Audit

Run a final pass.
Are you exposing API keys?
Are you sandboxing untrusted code?
